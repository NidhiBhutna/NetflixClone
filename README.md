# NetflixClone

The Netflix clone created using HTML and CSS replicates the look and feel of the popular streaming platform. It features a similar layout with a navigation bar, carousel/slider for showcasing movies or TV shows, and grid-based sections for different genres or categories. CSS styling is applied to mimic Netflix's color scheme, fonts, and overall aesthetic. While the clone doesn't have actual streaming functionality, it provides a visually similar experience, allowing users to navigate through content and get a feel for the Netflix interface.
